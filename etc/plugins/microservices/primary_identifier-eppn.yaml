config:
    # The ordered identifier candidates are searched in order
    # to find a candidate primary identifier. The search ends
    # when the first candidate is found. The identifier or attribute
    # names are the internal SATOSA names for the attributes as
    # defined in internal_attributes.yaml. The configuration below
    # would search in order for subjectID, eduPersonUniqueID
    # eduPersonPrincipalName combined with a SAML2 Persistent NameID, 
    # eduPersonPrincipalName combined with eduPersonTargetedId,
    # eduPersonPrincipalName, SAML 2 Persistent NameID, and finally eduPersonTargetedId
    # The microservice may be configured per entityID
    # The configuration key is the entityID of the requesting SP,
    # or the authenticating IdP. An SP configuration overrides an IdP
    # configuration when there is a conflict.

    # NOTES
    # The OIDC sub is only locally unique.
    # Also it is unknown whether we receive an oidc public or pairwise sub claim
    # To translate the sub to suitable SAML2 identifier attributes, we combine the sub with the entityid
    # Later we hash the combined value in an attribute processor to generate globally unique ids
    # We later proxy these ids to sps with a scope added in the attribute processor later on
    #
    # Technically the list of attributes does not need to be the way listed below.
    # Reason: the oidc sub is only internally mapped to saml2 edupersontargeted, so we do not expect it in any other attribute
